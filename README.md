# Smart Route Optimization Using Graph Algorithms and ML

This project implements an intelligent route optimizer that finds the best path in a city map, considering real-time traffic data. It uses graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s and A* for shortest path finding and incorporates machine learning for dynamic weight adjustment and traffic prediction.

## Features

- **Graph Representation**: City road network represented using adjacency list/matrix.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Dijkstra’s and A* algorithms for finding the shortest path.
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustment**: Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning) to adjust weights based on real-time traffic.
- **Traffic Prediction**: Machine Learning model (e.g., Decision Tree, Neural Network) to predict traffic congestion.

## Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang)
- CMake (for build system)
- Python (for data preprocessing and ML model training)
- Libraries: Boost, Eigen, TensorFlow (for ML)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-route-optimizer.git
   cd smart-route-optimizer
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./smart_route_optimizer

   
## Usage

### Graph Input
Provide the city map as a graph input (e.g., CSV file).

### Real-Time Data
Integrate with a real-time traffic data source or use simulated data.

### Optimization
Run the optimizer to find the best route considering current traffic conditions.
